## Styling & Theming  

- Uses **CSS Modules** for scoped styles, ensuring that each component has its own distinct styling.  
- Supports **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode** via global theme settings using **Context API**, allowing users to switch themes seamlessly.  
- The design is **responsive**, ensuring usability across different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
